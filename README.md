# Grade 12 Portfolio
This repository holds all of my Grade 12 Computer Science Projects, along with some extended projects from Grade 11.

## General Content and Organization:
### Graphical Applications
- Bouncing Ball Game
- Scale Solar System Model Project (add link to this, in other public repository)
- Two-Player Checkers Game
- Grade 9 Coding and Math Integration Application for Grade 9 Students at School (Grade 12 Final Project, in progress)

### Reusable Classes
- Array Class
- Insertion Sort Methods for Arrays and LinkedLists (added to Sorting class, which was created as a group project)
- Input Validation Class
- Vigenere Cipher
- Game Board Class (created for Checkers Game, but can be used for any JavaFX application requiring a game board)

### Other Console-Based Applications
- Run For It Dice Game
- Christmas List Generator
- Greatest Common Divisor Calculator based on Euler's Recursive Algorithm
- Fibbonacci Sequence Generator
- Simple Highscores File Editing Program

## Overview of Gr 12 CS Ideas/Topics Covered

| Concept | Programs/Files | Evidence/Description of Work With Concept |
| --- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Method Overloading | <ul><li>Array class  </li><li> MDArray class </li></ul>| My best examples of method overloading are for the Array.java class and the reverseRow, reverseColumn, findLongestElementRow, findLongestElementColumn, and printWithSpacers methods for the MDArray.java class (created by entire class). For both of these, I overloaded the methods for integers, doubles, and strings. |
| File IO | <ul><li>Christmas List Generator </li><li> Grade 12 Final</li></ul> | I used File IO basics in my Christmas List Generator program to store the list the user makes for later use. Also, I have done extensive/advanced work with File IO for the Grade 9 Coding and Math Integration application I am working on, where I programmatically write, compile, and run a different Java program, and send inputs and get outputs from the program using connections between different Output and Input Streams. |
| Data Structures | <ul><li>Grade 12 Final </li><li> Sorting class </li><li> MDArray class </li><li> Christmas List Generator </li><li> Checkers Game </li><li> and More!</li></ul> | **In-School:** I have used knowledge muli-dimensional arrays, hashtables, and dynamic arrays (specifically, ArrayLists) in the Grade 9 Coding and Math application for many different purposes. I have also dealt with linked lists when creating the Insertion Sort methods for the Sorting class. Finally, I have used arrays and multi-dimensional arrays in a variety of other places, including the Array class, methods for the MDArray class, the Checkers Game, Christmas List Generator, and more. <br> **Out Of School:** Mainly in C++, I have worked extensively with arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, stacks, queues, deques, maps, sets, hashtables, binary search trees, and graphs while learning and practicing competitive programming concepts.
| OO Programming | <ul><li>Checkers Game </li><li> Grade 12 Final</li></ul> | I used OOP in the Checkers Game, where I created a reusable GameBoard object and a more specific CheckersPiece object to use in the game. Moreover, I used OOP in my Grade 12 Final, where I created a multiple classes for each of the code blocks in the program, which had multiple subcategories and used the OOP concept of inheritance. |
| Graphics (GUI) | <ul><li>Bouncing Ball Game </li><li> Scale Solar System Project </li><li> Checkers Game </li><li> Grade 12 Final</li></ul> | All the listed programs have a GUI, which was created using JavaFX. |
| Recursion | <ul><li>GCD Finder </li><li> Fibonnaci Number Generator </li><li> Checkers Game</li></ul> | I used recursion in both the Greatest Common Divisor finder (as the Euler method required it) and for the Fibbonaci Sequence Generator. I also used recursion in the Checkers game to create the logic for when the player can make multiple jumps in a single turn. |
| Sorting | <ul><li>Insertion Sort Methods</li></ul> | I used knowledge of sorting to create the array and linked list Insertion Sort methods for the Sorting class. |
