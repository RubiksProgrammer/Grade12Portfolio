Pseudocode:

//ask for the number of players in game
//create an array that big to store player scores
//create a method to roll dice and roll six times
//order the numbers from the roll (store in array)
//if not starting at one, give player no points
//if not a two after a one, give player no points
//else, as long as its consecutive numbers, give player five points for each number
//if player reaches 100, declare them as the winner
//go to next players turn if they don't win
//ask if they want to replay (validate the input)
