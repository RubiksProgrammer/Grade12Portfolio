gr9math-coding created by GitHub Classroom

With the upcoming changes to the Gr 9 Math Curriculum in the fall we are anticipating that the government will include both financial math and coding skills in the curriculum
The purpose of the task is to give you an opportunity to develop your skills with Java while creating a project that can assist teachers/students in Gr 9 math next year by combining math concepts with coding concepts.

I want you to have fun

Let me know if I can help with anything.
